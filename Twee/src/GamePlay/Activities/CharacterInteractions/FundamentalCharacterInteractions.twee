::Fundamental Character Interactions - Observe a Target
<!-- TODO: For non-ethereal characters locally (that is NOT remotely) observing a target, the Stalking skill should be used and there should be a chance that the target will notice the character and that they will notice the character observing them. This will create a reference (a relationship) of the character on the target's stats with whatever is immediately observable and, possibly, the information that the observing character is "a stalker". -->\
